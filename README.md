A simple Android app that uses Retrofit to make http request to [Game of Throne](https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters/) api, retrieves the data and displays in a List. This app is built fully with Kotlin using clean arhitecture MVVM pattern.
The app uses data from the api to display Game of throne characters on the app main screen. When an item is clicked, a detail view of the movie character is shown on another page.
